    <h1 class="h2">Biography</h1>
    <p class="h2" style="margin:30px 100px 100px 100px ;">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, often referred to as the "People's President" and the "Missile Man of India," was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. His journey from a small town to becoming one of India's most beloved figures is a testament to his resilience, intelligence, and commitment to public service.

        Abdul Kalam's early life was modest, and he faced financial challenges. Despite this, his passion for learning and his determination led him to pursue education in aerospace engineering. He graduated from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1958 and joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). This marked the beginning of his illustrious career in the field of science and technology.

        One of Dr. Kalam's significant contributions came during his work on India's space program. He played a pivotal role in the development of satellite launch vehicles, earning him the nickname "Missile Man." The successful launch of the Agni and Prithvi missiles under his leadership showcased India's technological prowess and established him as a key figure in the country's defense capabilities.

        In 1998, Dr. Kalam's leadership reached new heights when he served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the DRDO. His pivotal role during the Pokhran-II nuclear tests demonstrated his dedication to safeguarding India's security and sovereignty.

        However, it was his presidency that brought Dr. Kalam into the hearts of millions. In 2002, he became the 11th President of India, a position he held until 2007. Dr. Kalam's presidency was marked by a focus on education, youth, and innovation. He often interacted with students, encouraging them to dream big and work hard to achieve their goals.

        Even after leaving office, Dr. Kalam continued to inspire through his speeches, writings, and interactions. He became a sought-after speaker, addressing students, professionals, and policymakers alike. His books, including the widely acclaimed "Wings of Fire," offered insights into his life, values, and vision for India.

        Tragically, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. His death was a profound loss, but his legacy lives on. Dr. Kalam's life exemplifies the power of education, humility, and perseverance, and he remains a role model for people around the world, especially the youth, who continue to be inspired by his teachings and principles.</p>
